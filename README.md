# COVID_Probability_Prediction_for_Patients
***A Machine Learning Based Approach on Predicting COVID-19***

This repository summarizes that the patient is infected or not from COVID-19.

Firstly, we create a model for checking the probability of patient i.e,higher the probability
higher chances of infection.  
Secondly, after creating a model we integrate it into flask app and predicting the result for COVID19.

## Tool
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Sklearn for model building
4) Google Colab notebook, visual studio code
5) Python flask for http server
6) HTML/CSS

## Libraries to install
In command prompt:
1)$ pip install numpy
2)$ pip install pandas
3)$ pip install -U scikit-learn

## Installing Flask
1)$ pip install Flask

Run the main.py in Visual Studio Code. Open the link
